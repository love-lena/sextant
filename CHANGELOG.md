## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pkg/bus` + `pkg/sextant`: **the connect handshake moves through the bus**
  (ADR-0019). The SDK no longer touches the backend directly at connect: it
  registers with a `clients.register` call (the bus writes the directory record,
  keyed by the client's authenticated id and stamped with the bus clock), leaves
  with `clients.deregister` on `Close`, and the **protocol-epoch hard-gate is
  folded into register** — the call returns the bus epoch, which the SDK
  exact-matches, plus the bus-stamped `connected_at` for the clock-skew announce.
  Cooperative **drain now delivers over each client's own push space**
  (`sx.deliver.<id>.drain`) instead of a broadcast on `sx.control.*`, so a client
  needs no permission beyond its delivery subscription to receive it; the bus
  targets an in-memory connected set (authoritative, not the eventually-consistent
  registry). This completes the "nothing direct" cutover for the whole data plane
  **and** the connect handshake; only the per-client credential allow-list flip
  (which makes the deny-only guardrail precise, and the stamped author
  unforgeable) remains. The SDK's `Client` no longer holds a JetStream handle.
- `pkg/bus` + `pkg/sextant`: **the push-stream operations and the artifact
  cutover** (ADR-0019). The bus now serves `message.subscribe` and
  `artifact.watch` as server-side relays into a client's private delivery space
  (`sx.deliver.<clientID>.<subID>`), each ended by a `subscription.stop` control
  op (or by bus shutdown, which cancels them all). The SDK's `Subscribe` /
  `WatchArtifact` and **all** artifact methods (`CreateArtifact`,
  `UpdateArtifact`, `GetArtifact`, `DeleteArtifact`) now go through Wire API
  **calls** instead of the backend directly — the artifact ops moved as one unit
  because the bus stores artifacts as frames at rest. With this slice the whole
  data plane (messages + artifacts) flows through the bus; what remains is the
  per-client credential **allow-list flip** (which makes the stamped author
  unforgeable and routes the connect handshake itself through calls), in the
  next slice. Crash-driven relay teardown — a client that never stops — is
  deferred to the liveness work (TASK-20), the same gap the clients registry has.
- `pkg/sextant`: **the SDK begins speaking the Wire API** (ADR-0019 cutover).
  `Client.Publish` now sends a `message.publish` **call** to the bus (which stamps
  the frame and appends it) instead of publishing to the stream directly, and the
  new `Client.FetchMessages` pulls a batch via `message.read` (cursor + resume —
  the pull complement to `Subscribe`, and the SDK half of the test CLI's `read`).
  `Client.ListClients` now goes through the `clients.list` operation too. Since
  the bus reads the whole registry on every client's behalf, a single corrupt
  record now **skips quietly** rather than failing the listing for everyone (the
  bus also sources each id from its authoritative registry key). (`Subscribe` and
  the artifact methods complete the cutover in the push-stream entry above; only
  the credential allow-list flip then remains.)
- `pkg/bus`: the bus now **serves the protocol's operations** as calls over the
  Wire API (ADR-0018, ADR-0019). A client makes a NATS request to
  `sx.api.<clientID>.<operation>`; the bus serves it against the backend interface
  (`internal/backend`), **stamps the frame** (id ULID, author from the call's
  subject token, kind, epoch; artifacts also revision + createdAt/updatedAt), and
  replies. Request/reply operations land here — `message.publish`, `message.read`
  (cursor-pull), `artifact.create/update/get/delete`, `clients.list` — with
  bounded concurrent responders (no head-of-line blocking) and reply-after-ack.
  The push-stream operations (`message.subscribe`, `artifact.watch`) and the SDK
  cutover follow. `internal/wireapi` defines the call subject scheme + the
  per-operation request/response shapes shared by the bus and SDK.
- `internal/backend`: the backend interface — the semantic contract
  (`protocol/semantic-contract.md`) as one internal Go interface the bus
  implements the operations against: a durable, ordered, replayable log
  (`Append`/`Read`/`Subscribe`, cursor = a bus-opaque synthesized sequence) and
  versioned records (`Create`/`Put`/`CompareAndSet`/`Get`/`Delete`/`Watch`/`Keys`,
  CAS on revision). A deep module behind a narrow interface; frame semantics stay
  in the bus. `internal/backend/natsbackend` is the first module (JetStream + KV);
  `internal/backend/conformance` is the executable contract every backend module
  must pass — so a future Redis module is portable by construction. See ADR-0018,
  ADR-0019.

- Go module (`github.com/love-lena/sextant`) and the polyglot-monorepo skeleton.
- `pkg/wire`: the wire atom — the JSON `Envelope` (`{id, sender, kind, epoch,
  record}`), the protocol `Epoch`, ULID-timestamp skew validation (`CheckSkew`,
  enforced sender- and receiver-side), and the per-message epoch check
  (`CheckEpoch`). `Record` is typed `Lexicon` (a `json.RawMessage` alias today,
  a seam for adding validation later). See ADR-0006 and ADR-0010.
- `sextant up`: runs the embedded bus. `sextant token <client-id>`: mints a
  per-client credentials file.
- `pkg/bus`: an embedded NATS server (JetStream) under **decentralized JWT
  auth** — one operator, one `SEXTANT` account, and **one user JWT per client**,
  so every connection is a distinct, verified identity and every op is
  attributable. Bootstraps the reserved `sx_` buckets; applies the client-tier
  guardrail (deny bucket/stream lifecycle, `sx_system` writes, `sx.control.*`);
  `Drain` broadcasts the cooperative-drain message. See ADR-0007, ADR-0012.
- `pkg/sx`: the reserved-namespace names (`sx_` buckets, `sx.` subjects).
- `pkg/conninfo`: the `bus.json` discovery file (URL only; credentials are
  per-client creds files).
- `pkg/sextant`: the Go SDK. `Connect` runs the connect handshake —
  authenticate with the client's own credentials file (`Options.CredsPath`,
  minted by `sextant token`), the protocol-epoch hard gate, a clients-registry
  write, a soft clock-skew announcement, a cooperative-drain handler, and
  auto-reconnect; with `Client.Drained`, `Close`, and `ID`. The client id
  (registry key and envelope sender) is read from the credential itself, so it
  is exactly the identity the bus authenticated. See ADR-0008, ADR-0010, ADR-0012.
- `pkg/bus`: publishes the protocol epoch to the client-readable `sx_meta`
  bucket at bootstrap, so clients read and hard-gate on it at connect (ADR-0015).
- `pkg/bus`: the client TCP listener opens only **after** bootstrap completes,
  so a client can never connect into a half-ready bus and fail its epoch read;
  the bus's own operator connection is in-process.
- `pkg/bus`: `sextant token` / `MintClient` reject a duplicate or malformed
  client id — each client gets exactly one verified identity, so two clients can
  never silently share a registry key (issued ids are recorded under
  `<store>/issued`).
- `pkg/sextant`: the Messages primitive. `Client.Publish` wraps a record in a
  wire envelope and publishes it to the `msg.*` space (waiting for the stream
  ack); `Client.Subscribe` delivers matching messages via an ephemeral ordered
  consumer with client-controlled replay (`DeliverAll`), checking each against
  the bus-stamped clock and quarantining skew violations. `pkg/bus` provisions
  the durable `MESSAGES` stream at bootstrap; `pkg/sx` adds the `msg.*` subject
  helpers (`ChannelSubject`, `AgentSubject`). See ADR-0005, ADR-0006.
- `pkg/sextant`: the Artifacts primitive — named, versioned units of durable
  shared work whose `Record` is a **Lexicon** (typed JSON), the same content
  model as a message's `Record` (ADR-0016). `CreateArtifact`, `UpdateArtifact`
  (compare-and-set on revision — the single-author-at-a-time discipline),
  `GetArtifact`, `DeleteArtifact`, and `WatchArtifact` (current value then live
  changes, deletes included via `ArtifactChange.Deleted`); a write is rejected
  unless the record is a non-empty valid lexicon.
  `pkg/bus` provisions the `ARTIFACTS` KV bucket at bootstrap, keeping **64
  revisions** (the NATS KV maximum). See ADR-0005, ADR-0016.
- `pkg/sextant`: `Client.ListClients` and the public `ClientInfo` type — the
  read half of the clients registry, a presence-only self-maintained directory.
  Every client already self-registers on `Connect` and leaves on `Close` (the
  write half); `ListClients` returns everyone connected right now (sorted by
  id), where "listed" means "registered and hasn't cleanly left." The record is
  `{id, kind, epoch, sdk, connected_at}`; heartbeat, read-time liveness, and
  stale-entry reaping are deferred (TASK-20). See ADR-0004, ADR-0008.

### Changed

- **Client identity is now a bus-minted ULID + a `display_name`** (ADR-0019, the
  §3 review decision). `sextant token <display-name>` (was `<client-id>`) now
  mints a fresh ULID as the client's primary id — bus-owned, unforgeable — and
  carries the human `display_name` in the credential (a JWT tag). `Client.ID()`
  returns the ULID; the new `Client.DisplayName()` returns the label. The clients
  registry is keyed by the ULID, and `ClientInfo` / `clients.list` carry both id
  and `display_name`. Display names are unique by convention, not enforced by the
  bus (so duplicate-id minting no longer errors — each mint is a distinct ULID).
- `pkg/sx`: renamed the bus "channel" convention to **topic** — `ChannelSubject`
  → `TopicSubject` and the subject namespace `msg.chan.<name>` →
  `msg.topic.<name>`. A topic is a named room (a naming convention over the
  messages space, not a bus construct); "channel" is reserved for the Claude
  Code harness push mechanism, to avoid the two colliding. See ADR-0017.
- `pkg/sx`: renamed direct addressing `msg.agent.<id>` → `msg.client.<id>`
  (`AgentSubject` → `ClientSubject`). "Client" is the universal term; "agent" is
  not a Sextant concept. See ADR-0018 / CONTEXT.md.
- `pkg/wire`: renamed the wire atom `Envelope` → **`Frame`** and its `sender`
  field → **`author`**, and unified messages and artifacts under one frame —
  added the `artifact` kind and the bus-stamped artifact fields (`revision`,
  `createdAt`, `updatedAt`). The frame is the bus-stamped wrapper around a record
  (record = user space, frame = bus space); `author` is the authenticated
  identity the bus stamps, not a client-set field. `pkg/sextant`'s
  `Message.Envelope` is now `Message.Frame`. First step of implementing
  ADR-0018 / ADR-0019.
