## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Summary

`sextant-shipper` is the NATS→ClickHouse pipeline. Per `specs/components/shipper.md`:

> "M6 ships the separate process; sextantd does **not** spawn it. The operator runs `sextant-shipper` manually (or via a separate launchd/systemd unit). Supervisor-loop wire-up is deferred to a later milestone (M7+ when the control surface lands)."

That gate has now passed (M7 shipped, M12 shipped). Wire it in.

## Impact

- `sextant audit query` returns empty until operator manually starts shipper
- Audit forensics depends on operator discipline rather than auto-supervision
- Same drift problem if shipper crashes — operator has to notice + restart

## Proposed fix

In `pkg/sextantd/daemon.go` startup sequence, after NATS + ClickHouse are healthy, spawn `sextant-shipper` as a subprocess wrapped by `pkg/supervisor` (same wrapper used for NATS and ClickHouse). Restart-on-failure with backoff; quarantine after 5 consecutive failures.

Configurable disable via `sextantd.toml`:
```toml
[shipper]
auto_supervise = true   # default; set false to run shipper standalone
```

## Acceptance

1. Default `sextantd &` boot → `pgrep sextant-shipper` finds it within 5s
2. SIGKILL the shipper → supervisor restarts it within backoff window
3. After a few RPC calls, `sextant audit query --since 1m` returns non-empty
4. `sextantd.toml` with `[shipper] auto_supervise = false` → no auto-spawn

## Implementation Notes

Migrated from plans/issues/feat-shipper-auto-supervise.md

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Implemented via pkg/shipperboot (mirrors pkg/natsboot / pkg/clickhouseboot
process-group lifecycle). sextantd's startup sequence spawns sextant-shipper
after NATS+ClickHouse, passing --config and --runtime-file. Shutdown unwinds
in reverse-dependency order (shipper → ClickHouse → NATS). New
[shipper] auto_supervise=true (default) in sextantd.toml; auto_supervise=false
preserves the M6 standalone-operator behavior. Binary path resolves to the
sextantd binary's sibling first, then PATH. Specs updated in
sextantd.md §"Startup sequence" / §"Shutdown sequence" and shipper.md
§"Wire-up to sextantd". Tests: TestSextantdSupervisesShipper,
TestSextantdAutoSuperviseOff, and the M11 walkthrough now asserts
query_audit returns non-empty rows without manual shipper start.
