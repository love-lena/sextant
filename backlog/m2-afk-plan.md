# M2 AFK run — tracker

**Gate cleared:** ADR-0019 **accepted** (`f62c942`, Lena "Ship it" + edits applied).
This is the live tracker for the autonomous M2 build. Design = ADR-0018/0019 +
`protocol/`; milestones/DoD = `backlog/docs/doc-1 - Roadmap.md`.

## Governing rules (Lena, 2026-06-04)
- **Scope:** all of M2 to MVP. **Go-only** (TS SDK is Future/TASK-5).
- **Forks:** ask **codex** → best-judgment → **proposed ADR** + flag; never stall.
- **Merge:** **stack for review** — each PR based on the previous; I open, do NOT
  merge; Lena reviews + merges the stack on return.
- Rebuild PRs run **lint+test(Go)** only; gofumpt; `pkg/**` needs CHANGELOG;
  footer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`;
  never `gh pr merge --admin`.

## Design deltas from ADR-0019 review (apply throughout the build)
- **ULID is the address for ALL three types** (clients, messages, artifacts);
  `display_name` is a non-keying attribute on clients + artifacts. `methods.json`
  artifact ops address by `id` (ULID), not name.
- **Call transport:** `sx.api.<clientULID>.<op>` request/reply over the existing
  JWT connection; **per-client ALLOW-list JWT** (flip from deny-only) makes
  `author` = the subject token (unforgeable). Push → `sx.deliver.<id>.*`. `msg.*`
  + KV become bus-internal. Reply-after-ack; bounded concurrent responders;
  bus-owned subscription cursors.
- **Backend interface:** semantic-contract as a Go interface; opaque synthesized
  cursors; watch needs a durable change stream (not bare keyspace events).
- **§5 is design philosophy**, not a hard M2 gate; idiomatic-NATS is fine; the
  hard guarantee is the unforgeable `author`.
- **Packaging:** Sextant impl under `internal/`; only `pkg/sextant` (SDK) exported.
  **Deep modules** (narrow interfaces, substantial impls).

## PR stack (stacked; bottom→top; status)
- [x] **PR1 `feat/m2-frame`** — `pkg/wire` Envelope→Frame (sender→author, ULID ids,
      kind message|artifact, artifact frame fields revision/createdAt/updatedAt).
      **PR #76 (open, base rebuild)** — build/vet/wire+sdk tests green.
- [x] **PR2 `feat/m2-backend-iface`** — `internal/backend` interface + NATS module
      + conformance suite. Redis-checked. **PR #77 (open, base m2-frame)** — green.
- [x] **PR3 `feat/m2-bus-serves`** — bus serves request/reply ops over `sx.api.*`;
      frame stamping; author from subject token; backend-served. **PR #78 (open)**.
      Push-stream (subscribe/watch) + artifact-ULID-addressing deferred to the cutover.
- [x] **PR4 `feat/m2-identity`** — client identity = bus-minted ULID + display_name
      (TASK-30 client half). **PR #79 (open)**. Artifact-ULID-addressing + artifact.list
      (the §3 artifact half) split to a later PR (entangled w/ SDK artifact methods).
- [x] **PR5 `feat/m2-sdk-client`** — THE CUTOVER, sliced (5a–5d-ii all landed;
      **the cutover is complete — nothing reaches the backend except through the
      bus, and the stamped author is unforgeable**). 5.5 below is a follow-on
      feature, not part of the cutover:
  - [x] 5a Publish→call + FetchMessages (message ops). **PR #80**.
  - [x] 5b ListClients→clients.list call (+ bus skips corrupt, key-authoritative id). **PR #81**.
  - [x] 5c data-plane cutover. **PR #83** (`feat/m2-cutover`, off #81). artifacts
        (create/update/get/delete → calls) + push-stream serving for
        message.subscribe & artifact.watch over sx.deliver.<id>.<subID> (relay
        registry + subscription.stop control op + shutdown teardown) + SDK
        Subscribe/WatchArtifact cutover. Artifacts coupled (bus stores FRAMES,
        direct stored raw) so all artifact ops moved as one unit. Codex-reviewed;
        lease/keepalive crash-teardown deferred to TASK-20 (same gap as the registry).
  - [x] 5d-i connect-handshake cutover. **PR #84** (`feat/m2-connect-cutover`, off
        #83). New internal ops clients.register (folds the epoch hard-gate — bus
        writes the record keyed by the subject token, returns {bus_epoch,
        connected_at}; registers only an epoch-compatible client) + clients.deregister
        (Close). Drain now delivers over sx.deliver.<id>.drain (bus keeps an in-memory
        `connected` set; "drain" subID reserved). SDK Client drops its JetStream
        handle; dead registryRecord/checkRecordKey removed. Deny-only perms KEPT →
        all green. TestDrainDelivers rewritten; new TestRegisterEpochGate.
  - [x] 5d-ii THE ALLOW-LIST FLIP — the security keystone. **PR #85**
        (`feat/m2-allowlist`, off #84). clientPermissions(clientID) deny→allow:
        `Pub.Allow:[sx.api.<id>.>]`, `Sub.Allow:[sx.deliver.<id>.>,
        _INBOX.<id>.>]`. `Resp` (allow_responses) NOT needed and OMITTED — the
        client is a requester, never a responder. With this NOTHING is direct →
        author unforgeable. Operator-side write seams added on `*Bus` (real methods,
        not on opConn): `SetEpoch`/`SeedClientRecord`/`DeleteClientRecord`/
        `InjectMessage` — the writes only the bus can do now clients have no backend
        access. Test rework: DELETED TestClientCanWriteConventionBuckets (premise now
        false) + added TestClientRegistersViaCall; TestStartBootstrapsBuckets +
        TestNoOperatorOnlyBucket → operator conn (`b.opConn`); client_test
        TestConnectRegisters/TestCloseLeavesRegistry → ListClients; epoch/empty/
        corrupt/skew/quarantine → the new seams. **bus tests now thread the minted
        ULID as the call subject** (the deny-only suite used arbitrary tokens; the
        allow-list rejects them — this was the non-obvious breakage). KEPT
        TestNoOperatorOnlyBucket + TestClientCannotPublishControl (stronger now).
        **Follow-up `681d620` (review fix):** independent Codex adversarial review
        found a [High] gap — shared `_INBOX.>` let any client eavesdrop on every
        other client's call replies. Fixed with a PER-CLIENT inbox: credential
        allows only `_INBOX.<id>.>`, SDK sets matching `nats.CustomInboxPrefix`
        (`wireapi.InboxPrefix`), + `TestClientCannotSubscribeForeignInbox`. Also
        hardened clientPermissions with a fail-loud guard for non-token ids.
  - [ ] 5.5 artifact-ULID-addressing + artifact.list (§3 artifact half; methods.json name→id).
- [x] **PR6 `feat/m2-cli`** — TASK-28: CLI (op-name parity) + conformance test. **PR #82**.
      Smoke-verified the M2 loop end-to-end (2 clients exchange msg + CAS artifact via bus).
      Recorded the loop as a charm-VHS demo (`docs/demos/m2-collaboration-loop.{tape,gif}`),
      committed onto #82 (`1651951`).
- [ ] **PR7 `feat/m2-mcp`** — TASK-22: MCP server + channel + skill (CC plugin).
- [ ] **PR8 `feat/m2-ergonomics`** — TASK-27: run/up --with-dir/per-client creds/
      --reclaim + getting-started + M2 DoD e2e.

Acceptance spine: the conformance test (PR6) + the M2 DoD e2e (PR8).
Parked: TASK-23 (request/reply), TASK-20 robust liveness (only --reclaim stopgap).

## Resumability
**THE CUTOVER IS COMPLETE.** Open PRs **#76–#85** (all green, stacked, unmerged).
DAG: #81 ← #82 (CLI); #81 ← #83 (data-plane) ← #84 (connect-handshake, 5d-i) ←
**#85 (allow-list flip, 5d-ii)**. After #85 nothing reaches the backend except
through the bus and the stamped author is unforgeable — the M2 SDK↔bus cutover is
done.

Current goal (Stop hook, 2026-06-05): *cutover complete + all PRs self-reviewed +
change stories sent to Lena's Manta for review.* **ALL THREE DONE:**
- **(1) Cutover** ✓ — #85 + the per-client-inbox review fix; full stack green.
- **(2) Self-review** ✓ — a self-review comment on every PR #76–#85 (a reviewer's
  guide: what to scrutinize + residual flags), and an independent Codex adversarial
  review of the keystone (#85) that caught the eavesdrop gap, now fixed + posted.
- **(3) Change stories** ✓ — `backlog/m2-cutover-change-stories.md` rendered to an
  editorial PDF and uploaded to the Manta `/INBOX/m2-cutover-change-stories.pdf`
  (device pulls on next sync).

**Blocked on human review** — the standing AFK goal is met. When Lena returns: she
reviews + merges the #76–#85 stack bottom-up (never `--admin`); annotations come
back via the Manta `/EXPORT` (pull with `flatten.sh`). Open review flags to expect:
operator write-seams placement (#85), `clients.list` skip-quietly shift (#81), the
deferred crash-teardown → TASK-20 (#83), drain-as-signal vs os.Exit (ADR-0010).

Next BUILD work (not part of the review goal): **PR5.5** artifact-ULID-addressing +
artifact.list, **PR7** MCP (TASK-22), **PR8** ergonomics + M2 DoD e2e (TASK-27).

Remaining BUILD work (beyond the current review goal): **PR5.5**
artifact-ULID-addressing + artifact.list (§3 artifact half; methods.json name→id),
**PR7 MCP** (TASK-22: server + channel + skill), **PR8 ergonomics** (TASK-27:
run / up --with-dir / per-client creds / --reclaim + getting-started + M2 DoD e2e).
PR6 already proved the DoD loop via CLI (+ VHS demo on #82); PR8 documents it.
